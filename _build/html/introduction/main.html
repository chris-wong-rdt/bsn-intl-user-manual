<h2><span class="section-number">1.1. </span>Brief Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#brief-introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The BSN design and concept as taken from the Internet, is a connected set of devices across data centers using the TCP/IP protocol. BSN is formed by the connection of the public city nodes using a set of blockchain operating environment protocols. Just like the Internet, BSN is also a cross-cloud, cross-portal, cross-framework, global infrastructure network.</p>
<p>With BSN, there are three types of participants: cloud service providers, blockchain framework providers, and portal operators.</p>
<p>Cloud service providers, through the installation of free BSN public city node software, can make their cloud service resources (computing power, storage, and bandwidth) accessible and sell through BSN to end-users.</p>
<p>Blockchain framework providers align with the BSN’s framework adaptation standards and deploy them on BSN so developers can use it to develop and deploy applications. The Permissionless service only applies to the BSN international portal and international public city nodes.</p>
<p>Portal operators can easily and quickly build a Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) platform on their existing websites using BSN APIs. This allows them to provide BSN capabilities to their end users without users leaving their websites.</p>
<p>BSN is an open network that any cloud service provider, framework provider, or portal operator, that complies with BSN requirements and standards is free to use and stop using the service network at any time.</p>
<p>Similar to the Internet, most users of BSN are developers and technology companies. They can use any BSN portal to purchase cloud resources that charge based on transactions per second (TPS), storage quantity, and bandwidth from any public city node around the world. They select any pre-adapted framework to conveniently develop, deploy, and manage permissioned blockchain applications at a very low cost. Blockchain developers only need to deploy the application to one or more public city nodes on BSN so participants can connect to the application at no cost through any public city node gateway. All deployed applications share server resources in every public city node. For high-frequency applications, public city nodes can intelligently allocate a dedicated peer node with high processing capacity. For low-frequency applications, they share the same peer node. This resource-sharing mechanism allows BSN to reduce the resource cost to one-twentieth of the cost of traditional blockchain cloud services.</p>
<p>BSN is a blockchain infrastructure network. Just as households do not need to dig their own wells, but instead, enjoy the water supply services provided by public water plants in cities, BSN blockchain application publishers and participants do not need to buy physical servers or cloud resources to build their blockchain operating environment. They use the public services provided by BSN and rent shared resources as needed, thus greatly reducing their costs. According to recent research, it takes about 20,000 USD per year for developers to build and deploy a traditional permissioned blockchain LAN-type environment. However, with BSN, the minimum cost to run such an application is as low as one dollar a day. Cost is a huge factor and will encourage a large number of small, medium, and micro enterprises and even individuals (including students) to innovate and start businesses through BSN. This will undoubtedly promote rapid development and popularization of blockchain technology. In general, the development from the closed architecture of the traditional blockchain to the resource-sharing architecture of BSN completely mimics the development process of the Internet, which gathered numerous isolated LANs in the early days to the global connectivity facilities we have today. We hope to make BSN the blockchain Internet.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, BSN provides a one-stop-shop solution for developers to deploy, operate, and manage DApps. BSN provides three types of services: Permissioned, Permissionless, and Interchain services.</p>
<div class="section" id="permissioned-services">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.1. </span>Permissioned Services<a class="headerlink" href="#permissioned-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>BSN is continually adapting most of the mainstream permissioned blockchain frameworks. On the BSN portal users can deploy DApps on any public city nodes based on the type of selected framework and the number of peer nodes. The number of peer nodes per application can be up to 60 and can be distributed among public city nodes based on different cloud services. Users can easily complete the DApp deployment process by uploading smart contracts and configuring the corresponding parameters. This service mode allows developers to focus on business innovation, smart contract programming. All work related to environment construction, system maintenance, application deployment, node transmission, and network configuration is done by BSN.</p>
<p>The pricing strategy for the Permissioned service is based on three resource elements of each peer node of the published application. The three elements are TPS, storage, and data traffic. Among them, TPS and storage in the BSN portal are pre-paid, while data traffic will be charged based on actual usage. This pricing strategy is designed to minimize resource costs and provide users with the best services. Based on the data provided by the BSN portal, if a user deploys a three-peer Fabric DApp, and each peer node supports 10TPS and 10GB storage capacity, the monthly fee is only 20 USD.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="permissionless-services">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.2. </span>Permissionless Services<a class="headerlink" href="#permissionless-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Permissionless service is only applicable to the BSN international portal (www.bsnbase.io) and international public city nodes. Compared with the complexity of the Permissioned service, Permissionless service has the virtue of simplicity. The Permissionless service mainly provides developers who develop public chain DApps, with unified access service covering numerous public chain nodes. Developers may choose different plans on the BSN portal, and can simultaneously deploy DApps and process transactions on all BSN adapted public chain nodes through the selected public city nodes.</p>
<p>We offer a free plan and different premium plans. The free plan includes up to 2,000 requests per day. There are 3 types of premium plans, priced at $20, $100, and $500 per month. The premium plans include up to 40,000 requests, 250,000 requests, and 1,500,000 requests, respectively, per day. All requests can be assigned to any public chain freely.</p>
<p>Permissionless services only provide shared nodes and access environments and do not involve any business of the public chain itself. The gas fees incurred in publishing and running DApps on any public chain shall be borne by the developers themselves and have nothing to do with BSN.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="interchain-services">
<h3><span class="section-number">1.2.3. </span>Interchain Services<a class="headerlink" href="#interchain-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The vision of BSN is to become the Internet of blockchains. In the future, millions of DApps will be deployed and run on BSN. Both Permissioned and Permissionless DApps will be very easy to call and they can interact with each other just like applications currently do on the Internet. From this perspective, Interchain will become a very core part of the BSN technical architecture.</p>
<p>The BSN’s “Interchain Communications Hub” (ICH) is now commercially available and integrates with Onchain’s Poly Enterprise and Bianjie’s IRITA cross-chain solutions. It supports cross-chaining between permissioned chains and cross-chaining between permissioned chains and ETH Ropsten testnet and NEO testnet.</p>
<p>A demo version of ICH is also live on the BSN Testnet, integrating two interchain solutions based on the relay chain mechanism: (1) Poly Enterprise developed by Onchain and (2) IRITA developed by Bianjie. We welcome all developers to try out and provide feedback and suggestions to us and we will continue to improve the interchain functionality.</p>
<p>BSN’s “Interchain Communications Hub” (ICH) integrates two interchain solutions based on relay chain mechanism: Poly Enterprise developed by Onchain and IRITA developed by Bianjie. It enables cross-chain interoperability between standard permissioned chains, open permissioned chains and public chains. We will continue to integrate more cross-chain protocols to achieve interoperability of all blockchains adapted to the BSN.</p>
