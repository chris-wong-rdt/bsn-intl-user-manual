Documentation
--------------

The direct users of the BSN portal are developers. As the environment and tools of the blockchain application's development, deployment, and operation, BSN is relatively complex in its overall operation. We strongly recommend that all developers start by examining the documentation and examples so that they will be able to master the use of BSN within a day or two.

For your convenience, all examples we've provided are available on Github. We hope that developers with serious interest can help us optimize and enrich the examples so that other developers are able to adapt and learn about blockchain development. Developers who share their samples, will receive small gifts and be invited to BSN's internal technical seminar.

For links to all documents and examples, please visit :doc:`../online_documentation` section.
