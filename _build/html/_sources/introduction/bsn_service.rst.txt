BSN Services
-------------

As mentioned above, BSN provides a one-stop-shop solution for developers to deploy, operate, and manage DApps. BSN provides three types of services: Permissioned, Permissionless, and Interchain services.


Permissioned Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

BSN is continually adapting most of the mainstream permissioned blockchain frameworks. On the BSN portal users can deploy DApps on any public city nodes based on the type of selected framework and the number of peer nodes. The number of peer nodes per application can be up to 60 and can be distributed among public city nodes based on different cloud services. Users can easily complete the DApp deployment process by uploading smart contracts and configuring the corresponding parameters. This service mode allows developers to focus on business innovation, smart contract programming. All work related to environment construction, system maintenance, application deployment, node transmission, and network configuration is done by BSN.

The pricing strategy for the Permissioned service is based on three resource elements of each peer node of the published application. The three elements are TPS, storage, and data traffic. Among them, TPS and storage in the BSN portal are pre-paid, while data traffic will be charged based on actual usage. This pricing strategy is designed to minimize resource costs and provide users with the best services. Based on the data provided by the BSN portal, if a user deploys a three-peer Fabric DApp, and each peer node supports 10TPS and 10GB storage capacity, the monthly fee is only 20 USD.


Permissionless Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Permissionless service is only applicable to the BSN international portal (www.bsnbase.io) and international public city nodes. Compared with the complexity of the Permissioned service, Permissionless service has the virtue of simplicity. The Permissionless service mainly provides developers who develop public chain DApps, with unified access service covering numerous public chain nodes. Developers may choose different plans on the BSN portal, and can simultaneously deploy DApps and process transactions on all BSN adapted public chain nodes through the selected public city nodes.

We offer a free plan and different premium plans. The free plan includes up to 2,000 requests per day. There are 3 types of premium plans, priced at $20, $100, and $500 per month. The premium plans include up to 40,000 requests, 250,000 requests, and 1,500,000 requests, respectively, per day. All requests can be assigned to any public chain freely.

Permissionless services only provide shared nodes and access environments and do not involve any business of the public chain itself. The gas fees incurred in publishing and running DApps on any public chain shall be borne by the developers themselves and have nothing to do with BSN.


Interchain Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The vision of BSN is to become the Internet of blockchains. In the future, millions of DApps will be deployed and run on BSN. Both Permissioned and Permissionless DApps will be very easy to call and they can interact with each other just like applications currently do on the Internet. From this perspective, Interchain will become a very core part of the BSN technical architecture.

The BSN’s “Interchain Communications Hub” (ICH) is now commercially available and integrates with Onchain's Poly Enterprise and Bianjie’s IRITA cross-chain solutions. It supports cross-chaining between permissioned chains and cross-chaining between permissioned chains and ETH Ropsten testnet and NEO testnet.

A demo version of ICH is also live on the BSN Testnet, integrating two interchain solutions based on the relay chain mechanism: (1) Poly Enterprise developed by Onchain and (2) IRITA developed by Bianjie. We welcome all developers to try out and provide feedback and suggestions to us and we will continue to improve the interchain functionality.

BSN's "Interchain Communications Hub" (ICH) integrates two interchain solutions based on relay chain mechanism: Poly Enterprise developed by Onchain and IRITA developed by Bianjie. It enables cross-chain interoperability between standard permissioned chains, open permissioned chains and public chains. We will continue to integrate more cross-chain protocols to achieve interoperability of all blockchains adapted to the BSN.
