Permissioned DApp Service publishers can create DApp services in the BSN portal. To create the service, it is necessary to upload the smart contract/chaincode package, define the service functions and roles, select the public city nodes and select the participant certificate mode (including Key Trust mode and Uploaded Public Key mode). After that, publishers pay the bills and submit the service deployment request to the network operator for approval and publishing.

After the successful publication of the service, publishers can participate in their service or invite other users to participate in the service. To participate in the service, participants should select designated roles and the access public city node, then generate the certificates according to the certificate mode set by publishers. Participation will be successful after being approved by service publishers.

Once successfully participating in the service, participants can download the certificate, and use the certificate and service access configuration parameters to access the chaincodes/smart contracts through the gateway API.
