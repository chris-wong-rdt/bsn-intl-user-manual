Terminologies

**Public city node (PCN)**:
    This is the core element of BSN but the “node” part doesn’t refer to the blockchain nodes and BSN isn’t a blockchain. With BSN, each PCN is a virtual data center used to allocate a portion of resources from the cloud service or data center on which it was deployed. An entire blockchain operating environment has been built within this resource pool and includes multiple blockchain frameworks, shared peer nodes, CA management, authority chain, PCN gateway, and PCN manager systems.

**DApp**:
    This is a generic term for blockchain and distributed ledger technology application.

**DApp Service or Service**: 
    This is a DApp that is already deployed and in use on BSN that users can access with an invitation from the DApp publisher. The invitation allows them to directly join and use the service.

**Service Publisher**: 
    This is the individual or enterprise who published and deployed the DApp service on BSN and is responsible for granting access to users who apply to participate in the service.

**Service Participant**: 
    This is a user that uses the BSN DApp service via a BSN portal or the publisher’s system. Also, the user’s off-BSN system can connect to the DApp service via the PCN gateway to execute transactions and query data.

**Off-BSN system**: 
    A business IT system developed and managed by a DApp service publisher or a service participant outside BSN.
