Preface
==================

Blockchain-based Service Network (BSN or Service network) is a worldwide infrastructure network that provides a one-stop-shop solution for blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) applications (DApp). BSN is a complex system that involves programming, software development, resource and environment configurations, application deployment, gateway APIs, local SDK, key certificates, etc. To facilitate utilization, BSN International (www.bsnbase.io) has prepared this document for developers and users to learn how to use BSN. We hope that BSN will become the first choice for developers to develop and run their DApps.

BSN provides developers three types of services: Permissioned, Permissionless, and Interchain services.

Permissioned services are divided into two parts. The first part demonstrates how developers can deploy smart contracts to the selected public city nodes through the BSN portal; the second part describes how developers can connect their off-BSN systems to the corresponding smart contracts through the public city node gateway and conduct data transaction processing.

Permissionless services determine how developers can choose the appropriate public city nodes, plans, and public chain frameworks, to deploy and publish their DApps.

BSN's "Interchain Communications Hub" (ICH) integrates two interchain solutions based on relay chain mechanism: Poly Enterprise developed by Onchain and IRITA developed by Bianjie AI. It enables cross-chain interoperability between standard permissioned chains, open permissioned chains and public chains. We will continue to integrate more cross-chain protocols to achieve interoperability of all blockchains adapted to the BSN.
